 1)odoo Default : In Odoo, sometimes we have to set a specific value for a field
 by default every time we create a record of that model. To achieve this task we
 have two key options/methods.

    1. Passing value through kwargs(**kwargs is a variable number of keyworded  
    arguments that can be passed to a function that can perform dictionary  
    operations.)
    2. Setting value with default_get function( This function is used to set the  
    values for multiple fields.)


2)configuration : The implementation of an ERP is a critical process. Whenever we implement an ERP we have to configure our functions and features. Here, configuration means enabling the features of the ERP in such a way that it will help the operations of your business.

3)OCA : Odoo Community Association (OCA) : The OCA allows you, as a member or contributor, to work independently in a community of peers who see you, support you and learn from you. We allow organizations to show their support for the Odoo open source community.
    **repo-github** = The GitHub repos for all Open Source work around Odoo - Odoo Community Association.
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 1)module : Odoo module is a set of business logic which helps to enhance the 
 existing functionality or add some new functionality in Odoo. All Odoo models  
 are created by inheriting from this class
  
   1)models(.py file hoi): In Odoo, A model is a class that corresponds to a  
   data relationship (table).
         
        1) Abstract model
        2) Transient model
        3) Models.

   2)views(xml file hoi):In Odoo, views define the way by which the  
   models/objects displayed to the user-end. Views is of several types, each 
   view represents a mode of visualization. They make the modules more 
   user-friendly and can vary according to the need.
